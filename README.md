Predict Used Car Price
=======================

# Business Objective 

Develop a model to accurately predict prices of used cars. This way my client, a used car dealership, can set the competitive price for their inventory.


# Business Success Criteria 



* Minimize the difference between predicted car price and actual prices.
* Figure Out which factor has the most influence on determining used car  prices. 


# Data Understanding 

This step includes looking at the existing data, missing values, splitting the data in training and test then imputing the values before training the model.


## Collect Initial Data

A dataset from Kaggle is used for predicting used car prices. This dataset contains 426K cars. Load the csv data to dataframe. 


```
df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Berkeley/module_11/vehicles.csv')
df.info()
```


A quick overview of data:


```
RangeIndex: 426880 entries, 0 to 426879
Data columns (total 18 columns):

```



## Split Data

Letâ€™s split the data first then we will impute the missing values.
